        <h1>Modern Medical Applications of Computing</h1>
        <h4>Medical expert systems</h4>
        <p>Expert systems are complex AI programs that are becoming increasingly common in the medical field. 
            Their knowledge bases contain both factual and heuristic knowledge. Factual knowledge is knowledge that is found in places such as textbooks or journals. Heuristic knowledge is less comprehensive and derived from experience.
            The reasoning of expert systems is either based on:
                </p><ul>
                    <li>Backward chaining: the system starts with a list of goals and works backwards if there is data which will allow it to conclude these goals</li>
                    <li>Forward chaining: the system starts with data available and then concludes a desired goal</li>
                </ul>           
        <p></p>
        <p>Some examples of medical expert systems currently in use are:
            </p><ul>
                <li>DXPlain, which generates diagnoses based on user input of patient symptoms, lab results and other clinical findings</li>
                <li>CaDet, which utilises a database of clinical data related to early cancer etection and cancer risk factors to aid in early cancer detection</li>
                <li>GermWatcher, which is deployed in hospitals to detect track and investigate infections in patients</li>
            </ul>
        <p></p>
        <p>Whilst expert systems have advantages such as being more efficient than humans, they also have multiple disadvantages:
            </p><ol>
                <li>Lacks 'common sense' needed in decision making</li>
                <li>Cannot respond creatively like a human expert would in unusual circumstances</li>
                <li>Knowledge base may contain errors which would lead to wrong decisions</li>
            </ol>
        <p></p>
        <p>As technology advances, these disadvantages will be mitigated and expert systems can have larger roles in the medical field.</p>
        <br>
        <h4>Medical robots</h4>
        <p>Robotics and a degree of automation in healthcare is a controversial topic but many medical experts see it as the way forward. 
            </p><ul>
                <li>Robotically-assisted surgery systems such as daVinci can be used for increased surgical precision. The surgeon is in complete control of the system at all times, however as the machine has greater reach and flexibility, smaller incisions made with more precision are enough to access the problem areas.</li>
                <li>Robotic nurses can carry ot the repetitive tasks of nurses such as drawing blood, checking vital signs and even taking care of hygiene if needed.</li>
                <li>Telepresence robots (e.g. Anybots Inc) allow off-site medical professionals to interact with their patients, checking on their living conditions and the need for further appointments, without having to make a time consuming home visit. </li>
                <li>Disinfection robots, using pulsed ultraviolet light, can disinfect a whole room in just a few minutes. This is being used to fight viruses such as Ebola.</li>
                <li>Robotic systems can be used to automate repetitive tasks such as dispensing oral solids in a retail pharmacy setting or preparing sterile IV admixtures in a hospital pharmacy setting.</li>
            </ul>
            Automation is increasing in all industries and it can bring many benefits to the medical field.
